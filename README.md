## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile page! I'm Alex Stout, a software engineer who's been working with JavaScript/TypeScript and Ruby-based tech stacks for about 4 years now.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: alex.stout55555@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a kid I used to hang upside down in my bottom bunk bed, and now as an adult I go to an indoor climbing gym ðŸ§—

A lot of my work lately is not in a GitHub repo, so read on and I'll tell you a little bit about it.

## Contributing to Firefox

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an open source contributor for Mozilla Firefox. It's been fun and interesting experience, and it's great to know I'm helping to defend the open Internet!

[![Mozilla Firefox Contributor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mozilla-Firefox%20Contributor-orange?logo=firefox-browser)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?email1=alex.stout55555%40gmail.com&query_format=advanced&emailtype1=substring&emailassigned_to1=1&emailreporter1=1) Click on this badge to see all the bugzilla items that my username is attached to. This  includes a complex 14-year-old bug I fixed, an enhancement I made to the search bar, and other items like my intro bug fix and a bug I filed myself.

I've also contributed as a secondary author to other bug fixes (or in one case simply determined that it was already resolved). These include:

- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1886894
- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1696236
- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1497064

## Unilogs

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Unilogs, the open-source log observability platform I co-created earlier this year!

I've pinned our repo, but the most enjoyable way to learn about Unilogs is to check out our website: https://unilogs.github.io/

I was the lead author for the case study, and I think it turned out nicely :) It's not too long, so give it a read!
